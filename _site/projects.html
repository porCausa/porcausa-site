				 		<p>The amount of global funding allocated to the health of children, mothers and newborns was multiplied by 2.5 between 2003 and 2010. More than half of these resources went to the 74 countries that concentrate 95% of the avoidable deaths of children and their mothers. Thanks in part to these efforts, the global number of children that die every year before the age of 5 has dropped to 6.9 million, from the 12 million of 1990.</p>

				 		<p>What countries were most successful and why? What has been the real impact of international aid? How can donors and governments extract the most out of the available resources?</p>

				 		<p>porCausa is creating a data repository that will help to respond these questions. The first project of this Cause will develop an immunization map that will help to analyze data on vaccines, a key factor in the increase of survival rates. We focus our analysis on three variables: innovation, delivery and financing of vaccines against some of the key diseases behind child mortality.</p>

							<p>We are analyzing the public funding that went to private and public anti-poverty organizations in the last couple of decades. Our intention is to create a open database that contains all the projects financed up to now and the available information on their impact.</p>

							<p>What information should citizens have on the taxpayers money that goes to the fight against poverty? What is the contribution of the Spanish Government? What are the priorities of the main private institutions working in this field?</p>

							<p>Our first project of this Cause analyses all the public money that went to development NGOs and institutions since 1992. With this project we want to promote a informed social debate on the use of public money against international poverty. The complete data series will be made available as soon as we finalize each phase of the work.</p>

				 		<h2 class="blog">Cause 3: Spain's infant poverty crisis</h2>	
							<p>It is estimated that one out four children in Spain live in poverty or social exclusion. The financial crisis is weakening the capacity of families and institutions to protect them, reducing the educational and social spending children depend on. The magnitude of this problem not only implies a social step-back of two decades, but also a sentence for hundreds of thousands of kids that will bear the consequences of these shocks for the rest of their lives.</p>

							<p>What are the drivers of Spain's child poverty and the determinants of their future opportunities? What are public and private institutions doing about it?</p>

							<p>Our first project will map the main variables and data behind this phenomenon: families' financial situation; access to housing and living conditions; food security; health; anxiety and other psicological effects; violence; etc. Each of these factors offers a particular perspective that should be analyzed and documented in order to have a meaningful social debate.</p>
