							<p>It is estimated that one out four children in Spain live in poverty or social exclusion. The financial crisis is weakening the capacity of families and institutions to protect them, reducing the educational and social spending children depend on. The magnitude of this problem not only implies a social step-back of two decades, but also a sentence for hundreds of thousands of kids that will bear the consequences of these shocks for the rest of their lives.</p>

							<p>What are the drivers of Spain's child poverty and the determinants of their future opportunities? What are public and private institutions doing about it?</p>

							<p>We are mapping the main variables behind this phenomenon, such as the financial situation of the families severely affected by the crisis; access to housing and living conditions; food security; health; anxiety and other psicological effects, and violence. </p>

							<p>For the four two years, journalist and author Martín Caparrós has traveled to Africa, Asia and Latin America documenting regions and people affected by chronic malnutrition, famine and starvation. He has retraced his journey in a book titled <a href='http://planetadelibrosmexico.com/el-hambre-el-nuevo-libro-de-martin-caparros/'>The Hunger</a>. We are working with Martín on a multimedia project combining images, his writing and data visualization to elaborate an in-depth explanation of chronic malnutrition in today's world. </p>

							<p>Poverty. Inequality. Evictions. Malnutrition. Six years ago, these words were stange to the Spanish population, back then enjoying an economic expansion that extended over a decade. In 2008, the 'economic bubble' exploited and it was followed by a severe economic crisis.</p>
