							<p>It is estimated that one out four children in Spain live in poverty or social exclusion. The financial crisis is weakening the capacity of families and institutions to protect them, reducing the educational and social spending children depend on. The magnitude of this problem not only implies a social step-back of two decades, but also a sentence for hundreds of thousands of kids that will bear the consequences of these shocks for the rest of their lives.</p>

							<p>What are the drivers of Spain's child poverty and the determinants of their future opportunities? What are public and private institutions doing about it?</p>

							<p>We are mapping the main variables and data behind this phenomenon: families' financial situation; access to housing and living conditions; food security; health; anxiety and other psicological effects; violence; etc. </p>

							<p>For the four two years, journalist and author Martín Caparrós has traveled to Africa, Asia and Latin America documenting regions and people affected by chronic malnutrition, famine and starvation. He has retraced his journey in a book titled <a href='http://planetadelibrosmexico.com/el-hambre-el-nuevo-libro-de-martin-caparros/'>The Hunger</a>. We are working with Martín on a multimedia project combining images, his writing and data visualization to explain chronic malnutrition in today's world. </p>

							<p>Poverty. Inequality. Evictions. Malnutrition. Six years ago, these words were stange to the Spanish population, enjoying an economic expansion that extended over a decade. In 2008, the 'bubble' exploited and kick-off a severe economic crisis.</p>
							<p>This project is a collaboration with the online publication <a href='http://www.fronterad.com/'>FronteraD</a> (specifically, with the journalist Maria Fernando Ampuero and photogher Corina Arranz) to document the Spanish population severly affected by the economic crisis.</p>

							<p>We are analyzing the public funding by Spanish Government that went to private and public anti-poverty organizations in the last two decades. Our intention is to create a open database that contains all the projects financed up to now and the available information on their impact.</p>

							<p>What information should citizens have on the taxpayers money that goes to the fight against poverty? What is the contribution of the Spanish Government? What are the priorities of the main private institutions working in this field? We have analyzed all the public money that went to development NGOs and institutions since 1992. </p>
